<h1>Create Virtual Server:</h1>
<h2>Description&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The <em>Create Virtual Server </em>workflow creates a virtual server and associates it with profiles, monitors, pool, and pool members in F5 LTM using Infoblox and ServiceNow integration.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/AppViewX/AVX-12.X-Visual-Workflows/blob/master/Create%20Virtual%20Server/docs/img/Automating%20Virtual%20Server%20creation%20with%20AppViewX_1.0-01-04.png" alt="Create virtual server flow diagram" width=“600” /></p>
<p>It uses a simple, self-service based approach to gather application-provisioning requirements and generate vendor-specific configurations or REST APIs. This self-service workflow filters F5 ADC devices based on the user&rsquo;s access permissions, defined by Role Based Access Control (RBAC). The platform integrates with IPAM systems like Infoblox, which allows users to reserve a free IP address from the available address pools and create DNS binding for the new virtual server in Infoblox.</p>
<p>The workflow also includes an option to create or bind existing profiles and monitors to the virtual server and allows users to create change request tickets in ITSM systems &not;like ServiceNow for approvals and tracking. The service request change ID is associated with the work order and is updated based on the implementation status.</p>
